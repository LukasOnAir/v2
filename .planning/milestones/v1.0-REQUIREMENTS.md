- [x] **PTAX-05**: User can add, edit, delete processes at any level

### Risk Control Table (RCT)

- [x] **RCT-01**: RCT auto-generates rows from lowest-level risk x process combinations
- [x] **RCT-02**: Each row shows full hierarchy path (L1-L5 IDs, names, descriptions)
- [x] **RCT-03**: User can enter Gross Probability Score (1-5)
- [x] **RCT-04**: User can enter Gross Impact Score (1-5)
- [x] **RCT-05**: Gross Risk Score auto-calculates (Probability x Impact)
- [x] **RCT-06**: User can set Risk Appetite threshold per row
- [x] **RCT-07**: When Gross Score > Risk Appetite, control columns appear
- [x] **RCT-08**: Control columns include: description, net probability, net impact, net score

### Column Management

### Risk-Process Matrix (RPM)

- [x] **RPM-01**: Matrix displays risks as columns, processes as rows
- [x] **RPM-02**: Cells show aggregated risk scores (average of children)
- [x] **RPM-03**: Cells are color-coded by severity (green to red gradient)
- [x] **RPM-04**: Matrix auto-updates when taxonomies change
- [x] **RPM-05**: Clicking a cell navigates to RCT filtered view

### Export

- [x] **EXP-01**: User can export RCT data to Excel format

### User Roles (Demo Mode)

- [x] **ROLE-01**: Role picker dropdown in UI (no login required)
- [x] **ROLE-02**: Risk Manager role has full access to all features
- [x] **ROLE-03**: Control Owner role can only edit control columns on assigned rows

- [x] **TEST-03**: Track control effectiveness ratings

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Authentication

- **AUTH-04**: User session persists across browser refresh

### Reporting

- **RPT-01**: Dashboard with summary statistics
- **RPT-02**: PDF export for board reporting
- **RPT-03**: Risk trend charts over time

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Multi-tenancy | Single deployment for v1; architecture for later |
| SSO/Corporate login | Email/password sufficient; SSO adds complexity |
| Production deployment | Local testing only for demo |
| Mobile app | Web-first; responsive design covers tablets |
| Real-time collaboration | Not needed for demo; adds sync complexity |
| Import from Excel | Demo will build data live; import deferred |
| AI risk suggestions | Emerging tech; defer to v2+ |
| Quantitative modeling | Monte Carlo/VaR requires specialized expertise |
| Full GRC suite | Focus on ERM; compliance is separate domain |
| i18n/multi-language | English only for v1; i18n adds maintenance burden |
