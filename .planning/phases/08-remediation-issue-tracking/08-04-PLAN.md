<objective>
Human verification of complete Remediation & Issue Tracking feature

Purpose: Validate all Phase 8 requirements (REM-01, REM-02, REM-03) are met through user testing
Output: Confirmation that remediation workflow is complete and functional

  <what-built>
Complete Remediation & Issue Tracking feature:
- Remediation data types and store with full CRUD operations
- RemediationSection in ControlPanel for viewing/creating/managing remediation plans
- RemediationForm for creating new remediation from failed tests
- Remediation Dashboard page with summary, overdue, upcoming, and table views
- Navigation integration via sidebar
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Pre-requisites:**
- Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173
- Ensure you have test data: at least one risk/process taxonomy item and some RCT rows

**Test 1: Create a Remediation Plan from Failed Test**
1. Navigate to RCT (Risk Control Table)
2. Click a control in the Controls column to open ControlPanel
3. In the Testing section, record a test with result "Fail" or "Partial" (add findings/recommendations)
4. In the Remediation section, verify "Create Remediation" button appears for the failed test
5. Click to open form, fill in owner and verify deadline defaults to +30 days
6. Submit the form
7. Verify remediation appears in the Remediation section with correct status (open) and priority

**Test 2: Manage Remediation Plan**
1. Find the created remediation in the ControlPanel Remediation section
2. Verify you can:
   - Change status (open -> in-progress -> resolved -> closed)
   - Add action items
   - Toggle action items complete
   - Remove action items
   - Delete the plan (as Risk Manager)
3. Switch to Control Owner role (Header dropdown)
4. Verify Control Owner can:
   - View remediation plans
   - Toggle action item completion
   - Cannot create/edit/delete plans (buttons disabled or hidden)

**Test 3: Dashboard Overview**
1. Click "Remediation" in sidebar to navigate to dashboard
2. Verify dashboard shows:
   - Summary statistics (total active, by status, by priority)
   - Overdue items widget (if any items past deadline)
   - Upcoming items widget (items due in next 7 days)
   - Table with all remediation plans
3. Create another remediation with deadline in the past
4. Verify it appears in Overdue widget with "X days overdue"
5. Create another remediation with deadline in 3 days
6. Verify it appears in Upcoming widget

**Test 4: Priority Derivation**
1. Create a row with high gross score (e.g., 5x5 = 25)
2. Add a control, record a failed test, create remediation
3. Verify priority shows as "Critical" (red badge)
4. Create remediation for low gross score row (e.g., 2x2 = 4)
5. Verify priority shows as "Low" (green badge)

**Test 5: Cascade Delete**
1. Create a control with a test and remediation
2. Delete the control from ControlPanel
3. Navigate to Remediation dashboard
4. Verify the remediation plan was also deleted (not orphaned)

**Test 6: Persistence**
1. Create some remediation data
2. Refresh the browser (F5)
3. Verify all remediation data persisted correctly

- User can create remediation plans linked to control test findings (REM-01)
- Remediation plans have owner, deadline, status, and action items (REM-02)
- User can track issue/finding status (open, in-progress, resolved)
- Issues prioritized based on associated risk rating
- Dashboard shows overdue and upcoming remediation items (REM-03)
- Data persists across browser refresh
- Role permissions work correctly (Risk Manager full access, Control Owner limited)
