## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Create Ticket with Linked Item
expected: Create a new ticket, add a linked item (Control/Risk/Process/RCT Row), save. The linked item should appear in the list with its type badge before saving.
result: issue
reported: "can we change the + button into 'Add Linked Item'. And maybe do it below the dropdown."
severity: cosmetic

### 2. Linked Item Persists After Save
expected: After creating a ticket with a linked item, close the form. Reopen the same ticket by clicking on it. The linked item should still be visible in the "Linked Items" section.
result: pass

### 3. Edit Ticket and Add Another Link
expected: Open an existing ticket that has a linked item. Add a second linked item of a different type (e.g., if first was Control, add a Risk). Save. Both links should persist when reopening.
result: pass

### 4. Remove Linked Item
expected: Open a ticket with linked items. Click the trash icon on one of the links to remove it. Save. Reopen the ticket. The removed link should no longer appear.
result: pass

### 5. "Other" Option Available
expected: When creating/editing a ticket, in the "Linked Items" section, you should see an "Other" button among the entity type options (Control, Risk, Process, RCT Row, Other).
result: pass

### 6. "Other" Shows Text Input
expected: When "Other" is selected as the entity type, instead of a dropdown, a text input appears with placeholder "Describe the linked item..." and a + button.
result: pass

### 7. Add Custom "Other" Link
expected: With "Other" selected, type a custom description (e.g., "External audit finding #123") and click +. The link should appear with "Other" badge and your custom text.
result: pass

### 8. "Other" Link Persists
expected: Save a ticket with an "Other" type linked item. Close and reopen. The "Other" link with your custom description should still be visible.
result: pass

### 9. "Other" Has No Jump Button
expected: For "Other" type linked items, there should be NO external link/jump icon (since there's nowhere to navigate). Other link types (Control, Risk, etc.) should still show the jump icon on hover.
result: pass

### 10. Links Survive Browser Refresh
expected: Create a ticket with linked items, refresh the browser (F5), navigate back to the ticket. All linked items should still be present.
result: pass
