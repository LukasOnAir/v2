## Current Test

number: 1
name: Approval Queue Database Sync
expected: |
  When logged in as authenticated user, navigate to Approval Queue.
  Pending changes should load from database (not localStorage).
  If another authenticated user creates a pending change, it should appear in your queue.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Approval Queue Database Sync
expected: When logged in, Approval Queue shows pending changes from database. Changes made by other tenant users appear in the queue.
result: [pending]

### 2. Approve/Reject Persists to Database
expected: Click Approve or Reject on a pending change. The decision persists to database with your email as reviewer. Change disappears from queue and stays gone after page refresh.
result: [pending]

### 3. Audit Trail Database Entries
expected: Navigate to Audit Log page while authenticated. Entries should show database-triggered audit events (changes to taxonomy, controls, RCT rows). Each entry shows entity type, timestamp, user, and field changes.
result: [pending]

### 4. Audit Trail Cross-User Visibility
expected: When another authenticated tenant user makes a change (e.g., edits taxonomy), that change appears in your Audit Log view without manual refresh.
result: [pending]

### 5. Analytics - Control Test Trends
expected: Navigate to Analytics dashboard while authenticated. Control Test Trend chart should display data derived from database control_tests table (if tests exist). Loading spinner shows during fetch.
result: [pending]

### 6. Analytics - Risk Aggregation by Category
expected: In Analytics dashboard, the Aggregation Report (risk by L1 category) should show data from database rct_rows and taxonomy_nodes. Categories reflect actual L1 taxonomy items.
result: [pending]

### 7. Knowledge Base Database Sync
expected: Navigate to Knowledge Base while authenticated. Existing articles load from database. Create a new article - it persists to database.
result: [pending]

### 8. Knowledge Base Cross-User Sync
expected: When another authenticated tenant user creates a knowledge base article, it appears in your Knowledge Base view. Both users see the same articles.
result: [pending]
